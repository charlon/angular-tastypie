angular-tastypie
================

Django project that serves a REST API using Tastypie. For the client, an Angular.js application consumes the API. It only made sense to ditch the Backbone/Handlebars architecture since Angular is more robust and much more lightweight. Going to enable PushState working as well with the routing.
