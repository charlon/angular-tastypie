ember-tastypie
==============

Django project that serves a REST API using Tastypie. For the client, an Ember.js application consume the API. It only made sense to ditch the Backbone/Handlebars architecture since Ember is more robust and already uses Handlebars for templating. Going to enable PushState working as well with routing.
